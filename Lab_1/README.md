# Laboratory 1

## Compulsory
* `parseInt` function is used to convert the binary string to decimal.
* To specify the introduction of a hex number `0x` notation in front of it si added

## Optional
* the command argument is found in `argv[0]` and converted to int using `parseInt` method
* after the project is build, first go to the root of the `com` folder within the `out` folder 
  then run the command `java -Xms4G -Xmx4G com.perosal.Main 3001`
* the running time in ns for an input bigger than 50 is equal with the difference between the time from
the end of the `Optional` function and the beginning of it
  
## Bonus
* a random graph is initialized then to get the random tree, the `getPartialTree()` function si used
and to show it as described, `showTree()` function is used. This function is efficient because it is based on DFS algorithm
  
More explanations are given in the function definitions.
